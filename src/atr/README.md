# `src/atr/`

Committed project architecture. As of 2026-08-02 (D-037), no longer empty:
D-013's core schema has been reviewed and promoted here.

## What's here

| Module | Contents | Promoted from |
|---|---|---|
| [`language/goal_graph.py`](language/goal_graph.py) | `Goal`, `Constraint`, `GoalGraph` dataclasses, `canonical_example()`, `dependent_goals_example()` | `spikes/task_schema_draft/goal_graph.py` |
| [`feasibility/oracle.py`](feasibility/oracle.py) | `goal_feasible`, `goal_achieved`, `goal_dependencies_satisfied`, `constraint_violated`, `evaluate_goal_graph` | `spikes/task_schema_draft/oracle_feasibility.py` |
| [`constraints/intent_guard.py`](constraints/intent_guard.py) | `validate_action` | `spikes/task_schema_draft/intent_guard.py` |

This is exactly D-013's original proposal (goal/constraint schema, oracle
feasibility, intent guard) plus the two schema questions that came up
during review and got resolved rather than deferred: `Goal.condition`
(D-026, kept as-is) and `Goal.depends_on` (D-037, was dead schema surface
until this promotion — see `goal_dependencies_satisfied()`'s docstring).

## Review status — read before trusting this as "reviewed"

**Self-resolved by the project owner (D-037), not independently reviewed
by the teammate this schema was actually written for.** See
[`ai-notes/review-request-task-schema.md`](../../ai-notes/review-request-task-schema.md)
for the full resolution of each open question, and its status banner for
what "self-resolved" does and doesn't mean here. Toy-scale evidence
throughout — promotion changed where this code lives and its accept
status, not the underlying evidence's scale. See
`ai-notes/decisions.md` D-013–D-037 for the full history.

## What's still in `spikes/task_schema_draft/`, not here

Everything that's *evidence for or against* the schema above, not part of
it: the controlled-grammar instruction parser, zero-shot CLIP and DINOv2
vision backends, the tabular Q-learning policy, the end-to-end pipeline,
and every environment variant. None of that has made its own case for
promotion yet — see that directory's README for the full narrative.

[`configs/`](../../configs/) and [`data/`](../../data/) (added alongside
this package, D-032) are still empty — nothing here yet needs
configuration or a real dataset.

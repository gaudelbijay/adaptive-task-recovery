# Decisions

Lightweight architecture decision log. Stable research design is in `docs/`.

## D-007: Simulated humanoid is the required target embodiment

- **Date:** 2026-07-26
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Keep feasibility and intent reasoning embodiment-agnostic, but
  require final evaluation on a simulated humanoid using a stable skill interface.
- **Reason:** The project is intended to apply to humanoids without conflating
  high-level strategy adaptation with learning whole-body control from scratch.
- **Consequences:** Simulator selection must support humanoids; Phase 0 validates
  an asset and low-level skills; results separate skill failure from incorrect
  infeasibility; simpler embodiments may be used only as intermediate testbeds.

## D-004: Feasibility-aware vision-language RL research direction

- **Date:** 2026-07-26
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Study whether a vision-language RL agent using self-supervised
  visual representations can infer goal feasibility after unforeseen,
  irreversible world changes and adapt without violating the original intent.
- **Reason:** This is the project's new primary research question.
- **Consequences:** The previous humanoid failure-monitor and recovery-skill
  architecture is superseded. Environment, modules, metrics, roadmap, and
  diagram must support language goals, feasibility, and intent constraints.

## D-005: Operational definition of intent

- **Date:** 2026-07-26
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Represent original intent as atomic goals, dependencies,
  priorities, hard constraints, and explicit substitution/equivalence rules.
- **Reason:** “Intent” must be machine-checkable for training and evaluation.
- **Consequences:** Claims are limited to this schema and must not imply general
  human-intent understanding.

## D-006: Simulator remains undecided

- **Date:** 2026-07-26
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Evaluate candidate object-centric visual environments before
  selecting a primary humanoid-capable simulator.
- **Reason:** ManiSkill was chosen for the old humanoid-control question; the new
  study prioritizes intervention control, language, and oracle feasibility.
- **Consequences:** Phase 0 includes a simulator spike. No simulator-specific
  architecture should be committed before it passes the selection criteria.

## D-001: Simulation-only scope

- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Develop and evaluate v1 in simulation.
- **Reason:** Enables reproducible interventions and privileged oracle labels.
- **Consequences:** Claims do not extend to real robots without further evidence.

## D-002: ManiSkill as primary simulator

- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Superseded by D-006
- **Decision:** Originally selected ManiSkill for humanoid recovery experiments.
- **Reason:** No longer aligned with the revised question by default.
- **Consequences:** ManiSkill is now one candidate rather than a commitment.

## D-003: Separate stable docs from live tracking

- **Date:** 2026-07-24
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Decision:** Keep stable design in `docs/` and live notes in `ai-notes/`.
- **Reason:** They have different audiences and update rhythms.
- **Consequences:** Keep cross-links and status consistent.
